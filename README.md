# Full-fine-tuning-BERT
Creating a BERT sentiment classifier through full finetuning

Here I create a BERT sentiment classifier (actually DistilBERT) using the Hugging Face Transformers library. You will use the IMDB movie review dataset to complete a full fine-tuning and evaluate your model.

The IMDB dataset contains movie reviews that are labeled as either positive or negative.
